Title:

When to Ship It!

Abstract:

You've poured your heart and soul into your latest project and everything seems to be working perfectly. So you ship it.

Then what? Is the site up? Can users complete payment? What needs to be in place before you consider your project ready for production?

This talk will cover the key components of any production system, including catching errors early, tracking historical performance, and correctly notifying the appropriate people during disruptions.


Reviewer Notes:

In the last 3 years of being a consultant, I've been assigned to 7 separate projects. Setting up projects in a production-ready configuration has become second nature. I've seen several projects launch prematurely (from a purely engineering perspective). I'd love to help others avoid the same mistakes.

This talk has been in the works for a while. By CodeMash, I will have presented it at local user groups.
